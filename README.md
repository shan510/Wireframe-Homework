# HW-Wireframe-Repo
The first thing I did in the index.html was set up the header and the footer. Then I typed in the title and linked the style sheets. 
In the body is where I set up the for the header, nav and section. 

Then I jumped over to CSS to start filling in the boxes and that helped me set up the article, section, aside and then I was able to finish the footer by copying  the header.
